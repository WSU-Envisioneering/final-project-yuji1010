            My jounrney through the Summer Bridge Evisioneering Program!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Throughout my Summer Bridge Program Experience, i learned that there will be times where you need to try over and over, there were times when my code wouldn't work or something in my program was bugged, and I had to use trial and error and keep on going until I finally cracked the code. This helped me develop skills to keep my anger emotions under control when things don't go right for me. My favorite class (Web 1400) was the most fun for me because the finished products of the websites we coded as a class astonished and amazed me. No&eumll is a great and amazing teacher! This program taught me great skills about computer science, coding, hardware, networks, and many other topics. Overall I would recomend this program to anyone looking to gain experience for computer science. Everything I have done has lead me here, from applying to this program, to learning the basics, to now being fluent in HTML, Python, and CSS! What I LOVED in this program was the incredible Tuesday activities. These activities would range from, tours in Adobe, to rapelling of a 4-5 story building. This program helped me gain the confidence that I need to for the future and helped me realise that I can conquer any task or problem if I just keep going and don't stop. Some things I think that lacked from this course were the amount of assignemnts, I think that maybe next program they should assign less assignments or make the homework assignemnts shorter. Overall, my experience here at the Envisioneering Program was Excellent!
